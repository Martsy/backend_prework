# Objects are created from classes
# Example of two objects from the dtring class:

"hello".class
=> String
"world".class
=> String

# Classes Define Objects

# good_dog.rb

class GoodDog
end

sparky = GoodDog.new

# Created an instance of GoodDog class and stored in the variable sparky. Now we have an object. Sparky is an object of class GoodDog.
